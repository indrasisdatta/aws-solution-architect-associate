1. How can you generate a trigger each time a tracked vehicle enters a specific geographic area?
Ans: Amazon Location Services - Geofencing (create geofence to mark the area of interest on map and track devices that enter or leave the area) 
     Tracking device (lat, long) -> Amazon location service -> Eventbridge -> Lambda -> SNS

2. An e-commerce company hosts app in US region. They want users from Europe and Canada to access without any lag. What's the proper AWS solution for this?
