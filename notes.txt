General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads. These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods of time.

File gateway - mount via NFS and SMB protocol 

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).

Elastic Fabric Adapter, Elastic Network Adapter 

The best way to encrypt an existing database is to take a snapshot, encrypt a copy of the snapshot and restore the snapshot to a new RDS DB instance. This results in an encrypted database that is a new instance. Applications must be updated to use the new RDS DB endpoint.

Global Accelerator (route TCP and UDP traffic to a healthy application endpoint in the closest AWS Region to the user)

Cloudfront - You can set up CloudFront with origin failover for scenarios that require high availability. To get started, you create an origin group with two origins: a primary and a secondary. If the primary origin is unavailable or returns specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin.
CloudFront cannot expose static public IP addresses.

RDS - You cannot configure a multi-AZ DB instance to run in another Region, it must be in the same Region but in a different Availability Zone.

AWS DataSync can be used to automate and accelerate the replication of data to AWS storage services. 
Note that Storage Gateway is used for hybrid scenarios where servers need local access to data with various options for storing and synchronizing the data to AWS storage services. Storage Gateway does not accelerate replication of data.

A VPG is used to setup an AWS VPN which you can use in combination with Direct Connect to encrypt all data that traverses the Direct Connect link. This combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also reduces network costs, increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than internet-based VPN connections.

Instance Store
You can specify the instance store volumes for your instance only when you launch an instance. You can’t attach instance store volumes to an instance after you’ve launched it.

Associate an AWS Direct Connect gateway with either of the following gateways:
- A transit gateway when you have multiple VPCs in the same Region.
- A virtual private gateway.

Route table - select target as VPG (AWS side of the VPN) and not customer gateway (customer side of VPN)

NACL:
 - Default inbound rule denying all traffic 
 - Default outbound rule denying all traffic
