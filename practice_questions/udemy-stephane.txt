Course Practice:

Q6. The engineering team at an e-commerce company has been tasked with migrating to a serverless architecture. The team wants to focus on the key points of consideration when using AWS Lambda as a backbone for this architecture.
As a Solutions Architect, which of the following options would you identify as correct for the given requirement? (Select three)
    Ans: 
        - Since AWS Lambda functions can scale extremely quickly, it's a good idea to deploy a Amazon CloudWatch Alarm that notifies your team when function metrics such as
        - If you intend to reuse code in more than one AWS Lambda function, you should consider creating an AWS Lambda Layer for the reusable code
        - By default, AWS Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC and hence have access to any public internet address or public AWS APIs. Once an AWS Lambda function is VPC-enabled, it will need a route through a Network Address Translation gateway (NAT gateway) in a public subnet to access public resources

Q8. A Big Data analytics company writes data and log files in Amazon S3 buckets. The company now wants to stream the existing data files as well as any ongoing file updates from Amazon S3 to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
As a Solutions Architect, which of the following would you suggest as the fastest possible way of building a solution for this requirement?
    Ans: Leverage AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) as a bridge between Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

Q10. You have been hired as a Solutions Architect to advise a company on the various authentication/authorization mechanisms that AWS offers to authorize an API call within the Amazon API Gateway. The company would prefer a solution that offers built-in user management.
Which of the following solutions would you suggest as the best fit for the given use-case?
    Ans: Cognito user pool 

Q12. The engineering team at an e-commerce company is working on cost optimizations for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. The team wants to manage the workload using a mix of on-demand and spot instances across multiple instance types. They would like to create an Auto Scaling group with a mix of these instances.
Which of the following options would allow the engineering team to provision the instances for this use-case?
    Ans: You can only use a launch template to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances to achieve the desired scale, performance, and cost

Q13. A media agency stores its re-creatable assets on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. The assets are accessed by a large number of users for the first few days and the frequency of access falls down drastically after a week. Although the assets would be accessed occasionally after the first week, but they must continue to be immediately accessible when required. The cost of maintaining all the assets on Amazon S3 storage is turning out to be very expensive and the agency is looking at reducing costs as much as possible.
As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate, can you suggest a way to lower the storage costs while fulfilling the business requirements?
    Ans: Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days
    (the minimum storage duration is 30 days before you can transition objects from Amazon S3 Standard to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA or Amazon S3 Standard-IA)

Q18. A retail company maintains an AWS Direct Connect connection to AWS and has recently migrated its data warehouse to AWS. The data analysts at the company query the data warehouse using a visualization tool. The average size of a query returned by the data warehouse is 60 megabytes and the query responses returned by the data warehouse are not cached in the visualization tool. Each webpage returned by the visualization tool is approximately 600 kilobytes.
Which of the following options offers the LOWEST data transfer egress cost for the company?
    Ans: Deploy the visualization tool in the same AWS region as the data warehouse. Access the visualization tool over a Direct Connect connection at a location in the same region

Q24. An IT company provides Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket access to specific users within the same account for completing project specific work. With changing business requirements, cross-account S3 access requests are also growing every month. The company is looking for a solution that can offer user level as well as account-level access permissions for the data stored in Amazon S3 buckets.
As a Solutions Architect, which of the following would you suggest as the MOST optimized way of controlling access for this use-case?    
    Ans: Use Amazon S3 Bucket Policies
